# koolture


Topic Modeling is an excellent method for deriving meaning from a corpus or corpora of text, the only caveat with it is that determining the perfect number of topics on which to split the corpus on can be tricky. For this problem, we bring you koolture. The name koolture came from it's original application of topic search onto positive and negative reviews from employees on companies across the US.

So, how does koolture works?

You will need
1. A corpus of text (e.g. reviews, tweets, comments, etc.)
2. A range of topics to do an initial search over
3. An optional list of companies, names, or any word that might need to be removed from the text
4. Optional parameters can be updated
5. Root of word method (the default being lemmatization)
